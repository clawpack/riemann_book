    "Notice that in the exact solution, the right edge of the rarefaction travels to the right.  In the Roe solution, all waves travel to the left.  As in the case of the shallow water equations, here too this behavior can lead to unphysical solutions when this approximate solver is used in a numerical discretization.  In order to correct this, we can split the single wave into two when a transonic rarefaction is present, in a way similar to what is done in the shallow water equations.  We do not go into details here."
