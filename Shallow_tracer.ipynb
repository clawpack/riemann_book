    "# Shallow water equations with a tracer\n",
    "\n",
    "We can augment the shallow water equations with a tracer $\\phi(x,t)$ that measures the concentration of a tracer that is advected with the fluid motion (and that has no influence on the fluid dynamics).  If $\\phi$ is measured in units of mass per unit volume (which is really per unit area in this one-dimensional example) then the mass per unit length along the $x$ axis is given by $h(x,t)\\phi(x,t)$.  The quantity $\\phi$ satisfies the variable coefficient advection equation in advective (non-conservative) form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\phi_t(x,t) + u(x,t)\\phi_x(x,t) = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is also called the \"color equation\", since we can think of $\\phi$ as measuring the concentration of a dye that changes the color of the water.  We will use this interpretation in the plots below.  By setting the intitial conditions $\\phi(x,0)$ to be piecewise constant with different values corresponding to different colors, we can visualize the motion of the fluid better.   We will use two shades of red for the water that is initially to the left of a dam at $x=0$ and two shades of blue for the water that is initially to the right.  \n",

    "The quantity $h\\phi$ satisfies the conservative form of the advection equation,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(h\\phi)_t + (uh\\phi)_x = 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This can be derived by combining the color equation with the conservation of mass equation $h_t +(hu)_x  = 0$.  Since $h\\phi$ measures the concentration of dye per unit length in $x$, and we assume molecules of dye are not created or destroyed, it makes sense that this is the conserved quantity.\n",

    "The Riemann solution for this system has 3 waves.  The wave speeds are the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix, and are $u-c,~u,~u+c$ where $c = \\sqrt{gh}$ is the gravity wave speed.  The 1-wave and 3-wave are the nonlinear shallow water waves, which can be computed as in the shallow water equations using the first two equations of the system alone (since the tracer does not affect the fluid dynamics).  The 2-wave is a contact discontinuity (linearly degenerate wave) moving with the fluid velocity and carrying only a jump in the tracer concentration $\\phi$.  The fluid velocity is constant across this wave and so characteristics travel parallel to the wave on either side.  The nonlinear waves can each be either a shock wave or rarefaction wave depending on the initial data.  Below we consider a dam break problem in which case there is one of each."
