    "In this chapter we investigate a conservation law that models the flow of traffic.  This model is sometimes referred to as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (or LWR) traffic model (see <cite data-cite=\"lighthill1955kinematic\"><a href=\"riemann.html#lighthill1955kinematic\">(Lighthill, 1955)</a></cite> and <cite data-cite=\"richards1956shock\"><a href=\"riemann.html#richards1956shock\">(Richards, 1956)</a></cite>).  This model and the corresponding Riemann problem are discussed in many places; the discussion here is most closely related to that in Chapter 11 of <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)</a></cite>.\n",

    "This nonlinear scalar problem is similar to Burgers' equation that we already discussed in [Burgers](Burgers.ipynb) in many ways, since both involve a quadratic (and hence convex) flux function.  The flux for traffic flow is convex downward rather than upward, however, and the characteristic speed is no longer simply equal to the conserved variable (but is still a linear function of the density).  Although the formulas are a bit more complicated, the mathematical structure is essentially identical to Burgers', and the traffic flow model has the advantage of a nice physical interpretation of solutions that may make it easier to understand the behavior of shock and rarefaction waves and how they relate to the flow of cars, a simple one-dimensional fluid.\n",
