    "Many other traffic flow models exist.  Some of them are *continuum models*, like the one presented here, that model traffic density and velocity as an aggregate.  Others are *particle* or *agent* models, that simulate individual vehicles.  You can see simulations of the latter kind at http://www.traffic-simulation.de/routing.html.  Shock waves and rarefaction waves naturally appear in such agent-based models too."
