Only at isolated points in space and time do multiple shocks interact.\n",

    "The key remaining ingredient is the choice of the wave speeds $s_1, s_2$.  These should approximate the wave speeds appearing in the true Riemann solution.  In general, it is desirable for the purpose of stability that the speeds used be approximations of the fastest (left- and right-going) waves in the Riemann solution.  Indeed, in the original paper of Harten, Lax, and van Leer <cite data-cite=\"HLL\"><a href=\"riemann.html#HLL\">(Harten, Lax, and van Leer)</a></cite> it was proposed to use lower and upper bounds on the true wave speeds.  However, overestimating the wave speeds leads to increased diffusion, and various refinements to the choice of wave speeds were subsequently proposed.  Here we choose the wave speeds based on a suggestion of Einfeldt (originally in the context of the Euler equations); the resulting solver is often referred to as an HLLE solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the shallow water system, the 1-wave speed is always less than or equal to the 2-wave speed.  If the 1-wave is a rarefaction, then the minimum wave velocity is given simply by $\\lambda_1(q_l)$, the characteristic speed at the left edge of the 1-rarefaction fan.  If the left-going wave speed is a shock, then the minimum wave velocity is the shock speed.  We cannot determine the shock speed exactly without solving the Riemann problem -- just what we hope to avoid.  Instead, we can use an approximate shock speed based on the Roe average:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{s}_1 = \\hat{u} - \\hat{c}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't know whether the 1-wave should be a shock or a rarefaction, we use a lower bound on these two speeds, by taking their minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_1 = \\min\\left(\\lambda_1(q_l), \\hat{u}-\\hat{c}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the second wave speed is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_2 = \\max\\left(\\lambda_2(q_r), \\hat{u}+\\hat{c}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the definition of the solver. Notice that if the states $q_r, q_l$ are connected by a single 2-shock, then the value of $s_2$ will be the exact shock speed (since the Roe speed is exact in this case, and the shock speed will be faster than the characteristic speed ahead of it).  Furthermore, by substituting the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions into \\eqref{SWA:hll_middle_state}, one sees that the the middle state in this case will be $q_m = q_l$.  Thus the HLL solver gives the exact solution for this case.  Similarly, it yields the exact solution when the initial states are connected by just a 1-shock.  It shares this nice property with the Roe solver (as long as the wave speeds are chosen as just described)."
