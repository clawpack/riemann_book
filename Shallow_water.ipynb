The portion of each curve that satisfies the entropy condition is plotted as a solid line, while the entropy-violating parts are plotted as dashed lines.  The curves are plotted for both the left and right states.  Thus the function $\\phi_l$ just described consists of the solid curve (blue and red parts) passing through the left state $q_\\ell$; the function $\\phi_r$ is the solid curve (blue and red parts) passing through $q_r$.  The intersection of these curves is labeled $q_m$. "
