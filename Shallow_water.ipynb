These centered rarefactions still have the structure derived above; to complete the solution we only need to know the range of centered characteristics included in each rarefaction.  This is most conveniently determined by considering the $h-u$ plane.  The 1-integral curve passing through $q_l$ is given by $u = u_l + 2(\\sqrt{gh_l}-\\sqrt{gh_r})$; it reaches a dry state $h=0$ at $u=u_l + 2\\sqrt{gh_l}$.  Similarly, the 2-integral curve passing through $q_r$ reaches a dry state $h=0$ at $u=u_r - 2\\sqrt{gh_r}$.  Thus the dry state solution is given by\n",
