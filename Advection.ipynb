    "We start our study with the scalar, linear hyperbolic PDE: the advection equation.  In this chapter we consider one of the most simple hyperbolic conservation laws, the scalar constant-coefficient advection equation. The solution to this equation simply consists of the initial condition propagating with constant velocity. This equation is extremely important to understand before tackling linear hyerbolic systems, which can be solved by decoupling the system into a set of advection equations. We first describe the physical origin of this equation and then investigate the solution to its Riemann problem. This equation is studied in more detail in Chapter 2 of <cite data-cite=\"fvmhp\"><a href=\"riemann.html#fvmhp\">(LeVeque, 2002)</a></cite>."
