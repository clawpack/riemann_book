    "The scalar nonlinear conservation law $q_t + f(q)_x = 0$ is said to be \"genuinely nonlinear\" over some range of states between $q_l$ and $q_r$ if $f''(q) \\neq 0$ for all $q$ between these values.  This is true in particular if $f(q)$ is any quadratic function, for example the flux function for Burgers' equation and the LWR traffic flow model are genuinely nonlinear for all $q$.  The reason this is important is that it means that the characteristic speed $f'(q)$ is either monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing over the interval between $q_l$ and $q_r$.  As discussed already in chapters [Burgers.ipynb](Burgers.ipynb) and [Traffic_flow.ipynb](Traffic_flow.ipynb), if $f'(q)$ is increasing as $q$ varies from $q_l$ to $q_r$ then the initial discontinuity of a Riemann problem spreads out into a smooth single-valued rarefaction wave.  On the other hand if $f'(q)$ is decreasing then the discontinuity propagates as a single shock wave with speed given by the Rankine-Hugoniot condition.  Hence the Riemann solution for a genuinely nonlinear scalar equation always consists of either a single rarefaction wave or a single shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution can be much more complicated if $f''(q)$ vanishes somewhere between $q_l$ and $q_r$, since this means that the characteristic speed may not vary monotonically.  As we will illustrate below, for a scalar conservation law of this type the solution to the Riemann problem might consist of multiple shocks and rarefaction waves.  These waves all originate from $x=0$ and the Riemann solution is still a similarity solution $q(x,t) = Q(x/t)$ for some single-valued function $Q(\\xi)$, but determining the right set of waves is more challenging.  Below we present results computed using an elegant form of the solution to general scalar conservation laws due to Osher."

The scalar advection equation has $f(q) = aq$ with constant characteristic speed $f'(q)\\equiv a$ and so $f''(q) \\equiv 0$ for all values of $q$.  Since it is a linear equation, it naturally fails to be genuinely nonlinear over any range of $q$ values.\n",

They are neither impinging on the discontinuity (as in a shock wave, where the characteristic speed decreases from $q_l$ to $q_r$) nor are they spreading out (as they would in a rarefaction wave with $f'(q)$ increasing).

    "## Implications to systems of equations\n",
    "\n",
    "For hyperoblic systems of $m$ equations, there are $m$ different characteristic fields. For classical nonlinear systems such as the shallow water equations or the Euler equations of gas dynamics, the Riemann solution generally consists of $m$ waves, each of which is either a discontinuity or a rarefaction wave.  The fact that there is only one wave in each family results from the fact that, for these systems, each characteristic speed either varies monotonically through the wave (if the field is genuinely nonlinear) or else is constant across the wave (if the field is linearly degenerate).  In the former case the wave is either a single shock or rarefaction wave, and in the latter case the wave is a \"contact discontinuity\", as discussed further in [Shallow_water_tracer](Shallow_water_tracer.ipynb) and [Euler.ipynb](Euler.ipynb).  As in the case of scalar advection, the characteristic speed is constant across a contact discontinuity ($f'(q) \\equiv 0$ between the left and right states). The definition of genuine nonlinearity and linear degeneracy for systems of equations is given in [Shallow_water_tracer](Shallow_water_tracer.ipynb).\n",
