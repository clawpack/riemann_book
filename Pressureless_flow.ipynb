    "(1) In the example below, the initial velocity is zero for both states.  Observe that multiplying the value of $g$ by a factor $\\alpha$ is equivalent to rescaling all the velocities by $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$.  Prove that this scaling must hold for any Riemann solution of this system when $u_l = u_r = 0$.\n"

    "(2) Here we have considered the large Froude number limit.  What happens in the low Froude number limit?  What form do the integral curves and Hugoniot loci take?  What happens to the hyperbolic structure of the system?  To the solution of the Riemann problem?  You may wish to modify the examples above to allow for much larger values of $g$ in order to check your answers."
