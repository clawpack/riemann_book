    "## Aims and scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This book addresses an important class of mathematical problems (the \"Riemann problem\") for nonlinear wave equations.  This problem arises in applications such as fluid dynamics, traffic flow, water waves, and electromagnetic waves.  The solution of the Riemann problem captures essential information about the model.  It is also the key ingredient in modern numerical methods for such models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The book aims to cover the fundamental ideas related to classical Riemann solutions, including their special structure and the types of waves that arise.  It will also cover the ideas behind fast approximate solvers for the Riemann problem, and more advanced concepts related to non-classical Riemann problems.  The emphasis is on the general ideas but most chapters delve into a particular application to illustrate them."

    "## Book formats\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is available in two formats: \n",
    " - The traditional print medium, in the form of either a physical book or an electronic PDF.  \n",
    " - As a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The print version\n",
    "Like any mathematical text, the paper (or PDF) version of this book includes mathematical descriptions and derivations.  It also includes figures, most of which are generated by short Python programs.  The code for those Python programs is included inline in the text at the same point where each figure appears.  The reader may choose to skip the code sections, especially on a first reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Jupyter notebook version\n",
    "In the electronic version of this book, each chapter is a Jupyter notebook.  The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.  The notebooks that form this text have some additional benefits not present in the print version:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Some of the code in the notebooks generates **animations**, showing how solutions vary in time or with respect to a parameter.\n",
    "  - Other code in the notebooks generates **interactive \"widgets\"** that allow the reader to vary multiple parameters or plot different quantities, in order to gain deeper insight and understanding.\n",
    "  - The reader can also **modify the code itself**, perhaps to vary parameters that we (the authors) didn't think of.  We encourage readers to use this to satisfy their own curiosity and enhance their learning.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### How to access and run the Jupyter notebook version\n",
    "In order to run the code in the Jupyter notebook version of the book, you will need to have certain tools and libraries installed on a computer, either locally or in the clous.  There are multiple convenient ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - With Binder:\n",
    "  - With Docker: follow instructions at https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/blob/master/Docker.md\n",
    "  - On your own computer: follow instructions at https://github.com/clawpack/riemann_book/wiki/Installation."

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The book includes 5 parts, each divided into several chapters.  The first two parts cover the fundamentals of exact and approximate solutions of Riemann problems; the remaining three parts delve into more advanced topics.  In a graduate course on hyperbolic conservation laws, the first two parts could be incorporated into the curriculum, while the later chapters might provide suggestions for student projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part I (*partially written*) covers the classical theory of the Riemann problem and its solution, introducing the reader to essential concepts including characteristics; similarity solutions; shock waves and the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions; rarefactions and Riemann invariants; genuinely nonlinear and linearly degenerate waves; and entropy conditions.  Building up from scalar hyperbolic PDEs and linear systems, it culminates with discussions of the full Riemann solution for the shallow water and Euler systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II (*not included in the draft*) introduces approximate Riemann solvers, which are an essential tool in numerical algorithms for hyperbolic PDEs.  This part discusses the most important approaches to such solvers: from simple Lax-Friedrichs and HLL solvers to linearizations, including Roe solvers.  Potential issues with these methods (such as the need for entropy fixes and lack of positivity) are addressed.  Part II concludes with comparisons of canonical approximate solvers for the shallow water and Euler systems.\n",
