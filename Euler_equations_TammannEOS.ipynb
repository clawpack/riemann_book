    "# Riemann problem for Euler equations with the Tammann EOS\n",

It can be physically understood as modeling an ideal gas under very high ambient pressures. The Riemann problem we want to solve consists of the one-dimensional Euler equations,\n",

    "### Solution in the pressure-velocity plane\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to visualize the solution is in the phase plane whose axes are pressure and velocity. We have a left and a right state such that each one is connected to some middle state by a shock or a rarefaction, depending on the entropy conditions. The connection is established by curves in the phase plane: hugoniot loci in the case of shocks and integral curves in the case of rarefactions. The intersection between these curves yields the middle state, which is the most important element of the solution to the Riemann problem. Lets look at an interactive plot illustrating the solution in the phase plane. The initial states and the middle state are indicated as black points; the Hugoniot loci are plotted in red and the integral curves in blue. The physical solution satisfying the entropy conditions is plotted as a continous line, whereas the unphysical solution is shown as a dashed line. Note that, in this case, the phase plane is three dimensional, but it is easierly understood when projecting into a two dimensional phase space. Nonetheless, the variable $\\rho$ in the flattened dimension can still be modified as an additional paramater of the solution."

    "In order to get the full solution, we still need a couple more quantities. Equations (\\ref{RH-phis}) will yield the contact discontinuity speed $s_2=u_*$ in terms of $p_*$. We can also calculate $F_l$ and $F_r$ from (\\ref{Qk-f}), and we can substitute in (\\ref{RH-speeds}) to obtain the corresponding wave speeds. With this, we can provide the full solution of the Riemann problem. In the next section, we will show the full solution for different examples. It should be noted that this model is to be handled carefully because it could yield unphysical results (negative pressures) for some initial conditions. The cases where this happens are in the limit of validity for modeling almost incompressible media with the Tammann EOS. We will explore these limits in Problem 4. Here we define a function to plot the exact solution of the Riemann problem and parameters that we will use for the different examples."

Atmospheric pressure is modeled at $p_{atm}=101325 Pa$ and speed in $m/s$. The density difference between the states is very small because water is almost incompressible. Note the small waves generated in the density plot and the very compressed rarefaction fan, which are consequence of the low compressibility in water."

    "### Problem 2: Air-water interface in shock tube\n",
    "We can use the Euler equations with the Tammann EOS to model wave propagation in almost-incompressible media, such as water. As we provided the solution with different EOS parameters on the left and right states, it can couple different materials across the interface. For instance, we can use this model to study the propagation of waves from air into water. Air is modeled by the ideal gas EOS, which corresponds to $\\gamma=1.4$ and $p_{\\infty} = 0$, and water can be modeled using the same parameters as the example before. Consider a shock traveling from left to right; the left state has only air while the right state has only water. Although in a realistic two or three dimensional setting, the water would spill into the left state, we can consider the water is being held in place by a container with a thin wall. In this setting, the current model has been shown to be a valid approximation <cite data-cite=\"del2016computational0\"><a href=\"riemann.html#del2016computational0\">(del Razo 2016)<a></cite>.

Nonetheless, negative pressures remain unphysical; therefore, if $p<0$ while $p+p_{\\infty}>0$, one should determine on a case by case basis if the solution to the Riemann problem is physically relevant or not.
