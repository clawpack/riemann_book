    "In this chapter we return to the LWR traffic model that we investigated in [two earlier](Traffic_flow.ipynb) [chapters](Traffic_variable_speed.ipynb).  The LWR model involves a single length of one-way road; in this chapter we will think of this road as a highway.  On a real highway, there are cars entering and leaving the highway from other roads.  In general, real traffic flow must be modeled on a network of roads. the development of continuum traffic models based on LWR and other simple models is an important and very active area of research; see for instance <cite data-cite=\"holden1995mathematical\"><a href=\"riemann.html#holden1995mathematical\">(Holden, 1995)</a></cite> for an investigation of the Riemann problem at a junction, and <cite data-cite=\"garavello2006traffic\"><a href=\"riemann.html#garavello2006traffic\">(Garavello, 2006)</a></cite> for an overview of the area.  Here we take a first step in that direction by considering the presence of a single on-ramp, where traffic enters the highway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the flux of cars from the on-ramp be denoted by $D$; we assume that $D$ is constant in time but concentrated at a single point ($x=0$ in space).  Our model equation then becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align} \\label{TFR:balance_law}\n",
    "    \\rho_t + \\left(\\rho(1-\\rho)\\right)_x & = D \\delta(x),\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.  Equation \\eqref{TFR:balance_law} is our first example of a *balance law*.  The term on the right hand side does not take the form of a flux, and the total mass of cars is not conserved.  We refer to the right-hand-side term as a *source term* -- quite appropriately in the present context, since it represents a source of cars entering the highway.  In a more realistic model, traffic on the on-ramp itself would also be modeled.  However, our goal here is primarily to illustrate the effect of a source term like that in \\eqref{TFR:balance_law} on the solution of the Riemann problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, source terms have only an infinitesimal effect on the Riemann solution over short times, since they are distributed in space.  The term considered here is an example of a *singular* source term; it has a non-negligible effect on the Riemann solution because it is concentrated at $x=0$.\n",

    "Recall that the flux of cars in the LWR model is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\rho) = \\rho(1-\\rho)$$\n",

    "where $0 \\le \\rho \\le 1$.  Thus the maximum flux is $f_\\text{max} = 1/4$, achieved when $\\rho=1/2$.  We assume always that $D \\le 1/4$, so that all the cars arriving from the on-ramp can enter the highway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed already in the [chapter on traffic with a varying speed limit](Traffic_variable_speed.ipynb), the flux of cars must be continuous everywhere, and in particular at $x=0$.  Let $\\rho^-, \\rho^+$ denote the density $\\rho$ in the limit as $\\xi \\to 0$ from the left and right, respectively. Then this condition means that\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "For $D\\ne0$, this condition implies that a stationary jump exists at $x=0$, similar to the stationary jump we found in the case of a varying speed limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to solving the Riemann problem is to focus on finding $\\rho^-$ and $\\rho^+$; the wave structure on either side of $x=0$ can then be deduced in the same way we have done for problems without a source term -- connecting $\\rho_l$ to $\\rho_-$ and $\\rho_r$ to $\\rho_+$ by entropy-satisfying shock or rarefaction waves.  This approach was undertaken by Greenberg et. al. in <cite data-cite=\"greenberg1997analysis\"><a href=\"riemann.html#greenberg1997analysis\">(Greenberg, 1997)</a></cite> for Burgers' equation; the main results (Table 1 therein) can be transferred to the LWR model in a straightforward way.  As they noted, there is typically more than one choice of $(\\rho^+, \\rho^-)$ that leads to an entropy-satisfying weak solution; some additional admissibility condition is required in order to choose one.  Herein we will motivate the choice of $\\rho^+, \\rho^-$ based on physical considerations; the resulting values agree with those of Greenberg et. al. (see also <cite data-cite=\"isaacson1992nonlinear\"><a href=\"riemann.html#isaacson1992nonlinear\">(Isaacson, 1992)</a></cite> for yet another approach that yields the same admissibility conditions)."

This makes sense -- both of these have the effect of reducing the rate at which cars from upstream ($x<0$) can proceed downstream ($x>0$).  Thus the Riemann solutions we find in this chapter will be similar to those found in the presence of a decrease in speed limit.\n",

However, a much more complicated model would be required in order to account for this; see <cite data-cite=\"delle2014pde\"><a href=\"riemann.html#delle2014pde\">(delle Monache, 1992)</a></cite> for an example of such a model.\n",

Hence there cannot be any right-going wave (a more detailed analysis shows that a right-going transonic shock is impossible), and it must be that $\\rho^+ = \\rho_r$.  Thus $D = f(\\rho_r) - f(\\rho^-) \\le f(\\rho_r)$.\n",
